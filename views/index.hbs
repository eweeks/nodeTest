    <h1>What is a Soundscape?</h1>
    <p>Soundscapes are the sounds or acoustics that surround us, sometimes
    called the acoustical environment.
    Soundscapes can be divided into three categories; geophony, biophony, and anthrophony. </p>

      <p><h3>Geophony</h3><p>Geophony refers to sounds that come from
      non-living components of an ecosystem, such as wind, water, and weather
      events like thunder or lightning.</p></p>
      <p><h3>Biophony</h3><p>Biophony is sounds from
      living organisms in an ecosystem, most often wildlife.</p></p>
      <p><h3>Anthrophony</h3><p>Sounds in this category are sounds that come from humans. Sometimes
        these sounds are intentional, such as talking, or singing. Most anthrophony sounds, however, are unintentional
      noise, such as sounds from airplanes or automobiles. Many of our electronics make sounds, though we are so
    accustom to them we often don't notice. </p></p>

    <p>Anthrophony sounds, primarily those that are unintended, can drastically alter a natural soundscape.
    This can have a lasting impact on the health of the ecosystem as a whole. Wildlife competing with mechanical noises
  can have a harder time finding food or mates. Animals that depend on sound to help them navigate can become lost or confused.
  </p>
  <p>Healthy soundscapes also benefit humans as well. Many studies have shown that natural sounds can reduce stress, increase
  productivity, and even speed recovery times of patients.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="container-fluid coverText">
    <h1>Why Study Soundscapes?</h1>
    <p>Studying a soundscape can tell us a lot about the health of an ecosystem. A healthy soundscape will have a diversity of sounds,
      and negative impacts on an ecosystem will quickly be seen in the soundscapes. Soundscape data can provide insight into everything
      from population numbers of a species, to effects of climate change. Studying soundscapes can also help us mitigate the effects of
      unintended human noise on an ecosystem.</p>

      <h1>Soundscapes in the National Parks</h1>
      <p>A parks soundscape are a combination of all the sounds within the park, including those inaudible to humans.
        Some sounds are critical for animals to locate a mate or food, or avoid predators. Other sounds, such as those produced by weather, water, and geothermal activity,
        may be a consequence rather than a driver of ecological processes. Human-caused sounds can mask these natural soundscape. The goal of the National Park Service is to protect
        or restore natural soundscapes where possible and minimize human-caused sounds while recognizing such sounds are generally more acceptable in and near developed areas.
        The quality of a parks natural soundscape therefore depends on where and how often non-natural sounds are present as well as their levels.
</p>
      <p>Both Grand Teton and Yellowstone conduct general soundscape studies that shed insight into the health of
      an ecosystem, and provide an archive of natural sounds. Additionally, both parks conduct soundscape research
      to look at specific impacts of human produced sound on the ecosystem. </p>

          <p class="captionText">Oversnow vehicles can have a large impact on soundscapes. Sounds from them tend to be loud
          and carry far.</p>
        </div>
      <p>The soundscape program in Grand Teton and Yellowstone initially focused on oversnow vehicle noise, such as snowmobiles, and the impacts
        they had on the natural soundscapes, as well as documenting just what those natural soundscapes were. As the parks winter use management has improved and evolved, oversnow
        vehicle noise impacts have been greatly reduced in both parks, especially in Grand Teton. This changed the focus of Grand Teton’s
        soundscape program to focus more on noise impacts related to the Jackson Hole Airport.
      </p>
      <p>Grand Teton National Park is the only National Park with a commercial airport inside of its boundaries.
      What impact does the noise from the airport have on the ecosystems in Grand Teton? Are there ways to negate
        effects of the airport noise? Such questions prompted a soundscape study in Grand Tetons looking at sound from the airport.</p>
        <div class="floatRight">

          <p class="captionText">View of the Jackson Hole Airport, located inside Grand Teton National Park</p>
        </div>
      <p>Sound data has been collected from a variety of locations in the park, including at the airport itself. Research has looked at
    how far reaching the noise from the airport is and what effects it might have. The information was also used to suggest
  changes to the typical airport flight paths in order to negate the impacts.</p>


  <p>Grand Teton's recent soundscapes studies have also looked into impacts from road related vehicle noise on the natural soundscapes.
    Additionally, the soundscape of the park’s wilderness areas are being studied to determine how pristine they are.

      <h2>Studying Soundscapes in Yellowstone</h2></br>

        <p class="captionText">Snowy Landscape in Yellowstone.</p></div>
      <p>Yellowstone National Park has been near the forefront of National Park Service units in understanding the importance of natural soundscapes and incorporating its protection into park management decisions.
        Yellowsone has especially focused on winter soundscape research, but summer soundscapes have been studied, including Yellowstone Lake and backcountry areas.</p>

        <p> Visiting Yellowstone in winter is very different than summer. In winter, the majority of the park
      is only accessible by skiing, snowshoeing, snowmobile or snowcoach. While most of the park is very quiet in winter, the areas with snowmobile usage see periods of very intense sounds. As winter is a very stressful time of
  year for the wildlife in Yellowstone, biologists wonder what impacts the noise from snow vehicles might have on the animals.</p>

    <a data-target="#" class="pop"><img class="textImages img-responsive" src="images/BisonSnowmobileShan.jpg"></a>
    <p class="captionText">Bison walking down road in winter. Snow vehicles, like the one here are the most common way to access the park in winter.</p>
  </div>
  <p>Studies looked at how far the noise from snowmobiles reached and the percentage of the day when noise from them could be heard.
    Long-term acoustic data has been collected from 50 locations in the park’s front and backcountry, with very low noise measurements of the park’s extremely quiet natural winter ambient sound levels.
  </p><p>Because of the extensive research, Yellowstone has been able to take important steps to help protect their unique soundscapes.
    Quantitative acoustic thresholds are included in the multiple winter use plans, and planning efforts of all types are now required to evaluate
    the proposed action on the natural soundscape and visitor experience.
    In addition, soundscape monitoring is madated within the park as a part of the the current winter use plan. Perhaps most important, interest in national park soundscapes continues to grow in the visiting public and park staff.
